# Milestone 4 — Database Design & Risk Management (Implementation/Integration)

## Purpose (TILT)
Finalize **platform-appropriate data design** and **risk strategy**; validate with customer; prepare professional presentations.

## Tasks — Common (All Teams)
- ✅ **Customer Meeting #4**: present DB design + risk register; capture ≥3 validation points/concerns; minutes uploaded.
- ✅ **Risk Register** (probability, impact, mitigation).
- ✅ **Database Design Diagram** (choose one per platform): ERD (relational) | CRD (NoSQL document) | Graph Schema | Other appropriate model.
- ✅ **Data Dictionary** for all entities/collections/nodes.
- ✅ **Updated DFDs** (if design evolved).
- ✅ **Lessons Learned Report** (all members contribute).
- ✅ **Poster** (Expo format) & **Pre-recorded Presentation** (YouTube link).
- ✅ **Final GitHub Repo** (organized, complete).

## Tasks — Team-Specific Focus
- Ensure the database model and risks reflect your feature area and **customer feedback**.
