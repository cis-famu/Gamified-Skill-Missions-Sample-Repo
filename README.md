# Gamified Skill Missions — Sample Repository

This **fictional sample repository** demonstrates how student teams can organize a semester project for a gamified learning platform. It includes **milestone-specific README checklists**, customer meeting documentation patterns, and templates.

## Project Pitch (Fictional)
**App Name:** PathQuest  
**One-liner:** A gamified platform where learners complete narrative-driven missions to build career-ready digital skills.

## Teams (Example Roles)
- **Team 1 — Onboarding & Profiles**
- **Team 2 — Missions & Narrative**
- **Team 3 — Skill Map & Progression**
- **Team 4 — Gamification (XP/Badges)**
- **Team 5 — Learning Content Integration**
- **Team 6 — Infrastructure (Frontend/Backend/DB/CI)**

## Repository Layout
```

> Use each milestone folder’s README to guide deliverables and upload **evidence** (PDFs/Word, images, GIFs), plus links to Google Docs/Figma/YouTube where applicable.

## Getting Started
1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b team-<n>/<feature>`  
2. Add your files to the corresponding milestone folder.  
3. Commit with conventional messages (e.g., `feat(m1): add charter draft`).  
4. Open a Pull Request; request reviews from at least **one other team** for cross-team feedback.
